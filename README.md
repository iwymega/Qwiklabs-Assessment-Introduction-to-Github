I am editing the README file. Adding some more details about the project description.
# Qwiklabs-Assessment-Introduction-to-Github
In this lab, you'll practice the basics of interacting with GitHub. You'll practice setting up an account, logging in, creating a repository, making changes on the local machine, and pushing changes back to the remote repository. We use these git operations to share changes from the remote repository to the local repository and vice-versa.
